### Context
I was working at HNI (Human Network International) at that time, and we frequently got requests	for custom dashboards from international organizations.
The requests were usually for a dashboard that could display data from HNI's data collection app, called Datawinners (non longer available).
We needed to add complex features like:
- Authorization
- Date Sync/ETL/visualization
- Data export
- Role/Permissions
- SMS/email notifications
- Map visualization
- etc

### Solutions/Contributions
I created a [boilerplate](https://github.com/hniopen/vfaCore) to allow us quickly setting up custom dashboards.
The boilerplate was based on Vuejs, Vuex, Laravel, and it was designed to be easily extendable & customizable.

I was the top 1	contributor, 280k	lines of code added, 120	commits. And I advocated for it to insure high developer adoption.
It was a great success, and we used it for many projects, in private repos.

###	Main tech stacks
Laravel, Vuejs/Vuex, c3js, Google Map, AdminLTE, Datawinners APIs (Pulling Data, Sending SMS)
